## [Unreleased]

### Kickoff UX — output hygiene & orientation (FR-UX-13..16)

> The `startd8` CLI is now **quiet by default** and self-orienting. Design + traceability:
> `docs/design/kickoff/KICKOFF_UX_REQUIREMENTS.md` (v0.7) / `KICKOFF_UX_PLAN.md` (v0.5).

**Changed (affects every CLI command, not just kickoff):**

- **Diagnostic logs are off by default.** The console log level is now `WARNING`, so internal plumbing
  lines (`<ts> - startd8.<module> - INFO - …`, e.g. `concierge.survey root=…`, language/provider
  discovery, the `Telemetry: ACTIVE` banner) no longer print during normal use. `INFO`/`DEBUG` still flow
  to the rotating file sink (`~/.startd8/logs/startd8.log`) and OTel at full fidelity; `WARNING`/`ERROR`
  still reach the console. **Downstream note:** consumers tracking the live SDK will see quieter CLI output.
- The OTel `Telemetry: ACTIVE -> …` startup banner moved from `INFO` to `DEBUG` (the error path stays
  visible).

**Added:**

- **`--debug` flag** (global, on the root command) **and `STARTD8_DEBUG=1` env var** restore the full
  `INFO`/`DEBUG` console stream for troubleshooting. `STARTD8_LOG_LEVEL` still takes precedence over both.
  This is a separate axis from `--verbose` (which controls domain detail, not logging).
- **A high-level intro banner** on every human-facing kickoff invocation — bare `kickoff`, `red-carpet`,
  and the kernel subcommands (`survey`/`assess`/`instantiate`/`derive`/`confirm`/`log-friction`) — a
  concise "three things you provide → Build" orientation, suppressed under `--json`/`--check`
  (`explain`/`guided`/`deepen` are exempt as self-orienting surfaces).
- The single "next action" now states **why** it's next, in plain language.

### VIPP — project-side negotiator/applier (new `startd8 vipp`)

> The project-side counterpart to the Concierge / Welcome Mat / Red Carpet hosts — the
> **OBSERVED(project)-authority dual of the FDE**. New package `src/startd8/vipp/` + host seam
> `kickoff_experience/vipp_seam.py` + `startd8 vipp` CLI. Design + traceability:
> `docs/design/vipp/` (`VIPP_REQUIREMENTS.md` v0.3 — reflective-requirements → 3-lens CRP;
> `VIPP_PLAN.md` M0–M6).

**New surfaces:**

| Surface | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `startd8 vipp init` | Opt the project into VIPP (creates `.startd8/vipp/`; the host then serializes pending proposals there) |
| `startd8 vipp negotiate` | Adjudicate the host proposal inbox against Sapper project ground truth → source-labeled dispositions (`$0`, deterministic) |
| `startd8 vipp apply` | Preview by default; `--apply` writes accepted proposals at **project human privilege** through the `apply_proposal` floor |
| `kickoff_experience/vipp_seam.py` | Host-side serialization seam — **additive & opt-in**; `proposals.py` is byte-for-byte unchanged |
| `EventType.VIPP_NEGOTIATE_COMPLETE` | One structured EventBus/Loki event per negotiation (counts + `project.id`, no free-text) |

**Design invariants:** file-protocol-first (Keiyaku contracts), out-of-process-only (the file seam is
the trust boundary), provenance-pinned apply (`kind`/`base_sha` from the trusted inbox, human-confirm
the sole content gate), VIPP mints only OBSERVED(project) claims (cannot forge SDK-mechanism
authority), byte-identical-when-absent when VIPP is not opted in.

### Deterministic project onboarding (new `startd8 project init`) — closes #76

> A single **deterministic (`$0`, no-LLM)** command that turns a directory into a set-up StartD8
> project: detects greenfield/brownfield, establishes the `.startd8/` role postings, makes the
> project **VIPP-inbox-*ready***, and provides a **`$0` non-interactive inbox producer seam** — the
> honest fix for #76 (previously the only inbox producers were the paid Concierge chat or a TTY-gated
> command). New module `src/startd8/project/init.py` (a thin orchestrator composing already-shipped,
> already-confined seams — no new write primitive). Design + traceability:
> `docs/design/project-init/` (`PROJECT_INIT_REQUIREMENTS.md` v0.2 — reflective-requirements loop;
> `PROJECT_INIT_PLAN.md` M0–M4).

**New surfaces:**

| Surface | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `startd8 project init [ROOT]` | Detect shape → establish VIPP posting (FDE via `--with-fde`) → make the project inbox-*ready*. Re-runnable as a clean no-op |
| `startd8 project init --proposals FILE` | Serialize an **authored** proposal set (YAML/JSON `{kind, …params}`); each entry validated per-kind before write (bad entry → exit 2, nothing written) |
| `startd8 project init --instantiate` | Greenfield-only: produce a single `instantiate` proposal (the one deterministic ground-truth→proposal mapping) |
| `startd8 project init --check` | Read-only drift audit of the init structure. Exit `0`=in-sync / `1`=drift / `2`=error |
| `startd8 project init --json` | Machine-readable summary for CI |
| `vipp_seam.ensure_inbox_scaffold()` | Extracted (FR-11) so the producer path and the inbox-ready path share one source and can't drift |

**Design invariants:** ground truth *adjudicates*, it never *originates* — a healthy brownfield
project is inbox-*ready*, not inbox-*produced*; the producer **never invents content**; production is
always gated on a real, declared gap. Every project-content write rides the confined `apply_write_plan`
(the SDK-owned `.startd8/*-context.json` posting metadata is a documented, sanctioned exception).
Idempotent + byte-identical-when-absent (SOTTO). Posture-encoding exit codes (`0`/`1`/`2`/`3`).

### RUN-007 empty-spec remediation

> **Heads-up for anyone working in the code-generation path.** Lands via
> `fix/run-007-empty-spec-remediation`. Closes the run-007 partial-delivery
> defect: Prime/Micro-Prime could ship empty-class stubs (`export class <stem> {}`)
> as *successful* `$0.00` output, and the post-mortem scored them ~0.94 (blind to
> the failure). Both halves — generation **and** detection — are now closed.
> Design + traceability: `docs/design/RUN_007_REMEDIATION_{REQUIREMENTS,PLAN}.md`
> (v0.3, hardened by a 6-round Convergent Review) and
> `docs/design/RUN_007_PARTIAL_DELIVERY_POSTMORTEM.md`.

**Behavior changes to be prepared for (by surface):**

| Surface (file) | What changes | What you'll observe |
|----------------|--------------|---------------------|
| `micro_prime/prime_adapter._generate_skeletons` | Empty-spec gate: a feature with **no fillable elements** (and no framework-config registry match) no longer gets a stem-named skeleton | The file routes to cloud file-whole escalation; if escalation yields no real content it is **refused** (`MissingTemplateError`, feature `success=False`) — never an unfilled stub |
| `complexity/classifier`, `complexity/signals` | FR-7 guard: an empty-fillable, non-registry feature is **no longer classified `SIMPLE`** | Such features route to the real-LLM path instead of the no-LLM SIMPLE tier |
| `forward_manifest_validator` (disk validation) | An empty stem-named type with no members now **FAILs** for source files (`ast_valid=False`, disk score ≤ 0.3) | The post-mortem *sees* a stub instead of scoring it ~0.94. `.d.ts`/barrel/marker files are exempt |
| `contractors/prime_contractor` (orchestration) | Threads remaining `$` budget into the generation context | Empty-spec targets are **refused (not escalated)** once `max_cost_usd` is reached |

### Added
- `startd8.element_fillability` — shared `is_fillable_spec` / `is_empty_fillable_spec`
  / `is_empty_stem_type_artifact` (positive fillability + run-007 stub detection).
- `startd8.exceptions.MissingTemplateError` — structured refusal for under-specified
  features (carries `root_cause` / `pipeline_stage` for post-mortem attribution).
- `TaskComplexitySignals.has_fillable_elements: Optional[bool]`.
- Generation-context key `_cost_budget_remaining_usd` (orchestration → micro-prime).

### Changed
- `micro_prime/prime_adapter`: empty-spec gate + escalate-or-refuse; a refused
  target now makes the feature `success=False` (no longer `effective_file_count > 0`).
- `complexity/classifier`: FR-7 fillability guard (new `has_fillable_elements` signal).
- `forward_manifest_validator`: empty-stem-stub disk-validation FAIL (FR-5/FR-6).
- `contractors/prime_contractor`: threads the remaining `$` budget to generation (FR-4).

### Compatibility
- All changes are **guarded / additive**: specs with real elements, and runs
  without a `max_cost_usd` ceiling, are unchanged. The `has_fillable_elements`
  signal defaults to `None` (no guard); the budget guard is a no-op without a cap.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-06-02

> **The deterministic-first pivot.** startd8 became a software-engineering harness for
> LLM-assisted development built on a Requirements→Capabilities delivery pipeline, with the
> explicit goal of maximizing deterministic ($0) generation and using LLMs only for
> integration. This entry consolidates the 0.3.x → 0.4.0 history (the changelog had no
> intermediate release entries).

### Added — deterministic code generation ($0, no LLM)
- **`src/startd8/backend_codegen/`** — projects one `.prisma` data-model contract into a full
  all-Python backend (Pydantic + SQLModel + FastAPI + HTMX + export/AI-schemas/completeness),
  ~12 owned file kinds, all $0-deterministic. Runtime-verified end to end against FastAPI +
  SQLModel + Jinja2 (FK / `Relationship()` / `@default` translation / reserved-name guard).
- **`startd8 generate`** CLI with four targets: `frontend`, `backend`, `scaffold`
  (pyproject/logging/alembic/Dockerfile from `app.yaml`), `views` (composite/relational views
  from `views.yaml`).
- **`startd8 wireframe`** — $0 read-only pre-generation summary of what the deterministic
  cascade will build, with `--json` for CI.
- **`startd8 polish`** — apply an accessible design theme to a built app ($0).
- `validators/python_toolchain.py` deterministic quality gate; `STARTD8_PY_TYPECHECK` env.

### Added — pipeline, contractors & evaluation
- **Prime Contractor** as the active multi-feature construction path (tier-routed
  template → Haiku → Sonnet), with checkpoint/resume, ~45 per-language repair steps, and the
  **Kaizen** cross-run quality feedback system.
- **`startd8 compare-models`** — run the same seed through Prime Contractor across 2+ models in
  isolated sandboxes (cloud and edge/local) and rank them.
- New CLI surfaces: `fde` (forward-deployed-engineer failure explanation), `sapper`
  (pre-execution plan validation), `assist` (Service Assistant run triage), `repair`,
  `manifest`, `workflow`, `project`, `serve`, `element-registry`.
- Embedded **Capability Delivery Pipeline** (`.cap-dev-pipe/`).

### Added — providers & languages
- Providers expanded to 8: added `nim` and `openai-compatible` (edge/local + self-hosted)
  alongside `anthropic`, `openai`, `gemini`, `mistral`, `ollama`, `mock`.
- Language profiles expanded to 7: added `vue` and `prisma` alongside `python`, `go`,
  `nodejs`, `java`, `csharp`.

### Changed
- **Artisan Contractor placed ON HOLD (2026-03-12)**; Prime Contractor is the only active
  construction path. Prime-vs-Artisan routing is vestigial.
- Primary Contractor naming: `LeadContractorWorkflow` is also exported as
  `PrimaryContractorWorkflow`; legacy `lead_contractor_*` names preserved for compatibility.

### Fixed
- Orchestration harden-in-place (R1-S2 gate ADR): per-run repair circuit-breaker scope
  (`RepairSession`), `deque(maxlen=)` event history (trim race removed), and `FeatureQueue`
  resume state-hash integrity with loud refusal on corrupt/invalid resume state. Also revived a
  silently-disabled post-integrate contract-violation repair path.
