# Audience & Content Layer — Requirements (speaking the app to its non-technical author)

**Version:** 0.3.1 (Draft — post-planning + lessons + principle hardening; pre-CRP)
**Date:** 2026-07-18
**Status:** Draft
**Concept key:** `FR-AUD` (Audience). The axis is **(role × fluency)**; values are populated incrementally.
**Primary persona:** the **non-technical app author** — the person the app is *for*, who knows nothing
about the SDK and must never need to. Secondary: the architect + other delivery roles (populated later).

**Builds / reuses (cite, do not restate — Mottainai):**
- The adopted-but-unbuilt **`audience` field on descriptive records** — `DESCRIPTIVE_LAYER_REQUIREMENTS.md`
  FR-DL-1 / R1-F1 (this spec *builds* it; widens `human`/`agent` → the `(role × fluency)` axis).
- The **resolver pattern + byte-identical-default guarantee** — `src/startd8/concierge/audience.py`
  (`KickoffAudience`, the flag→project→global→default ladder, unset ⇒ Intermediate ⇒ byte-identical).
  Reused as *precedent*; NOT overloaded (its axis is kickoff-walk fluency, a different concern).
- The **role taxonomy** — `docs/capability-index/*.yaml` `audiences:` + the FR-J delivery roles (architect,
  BA, PM, backend, …). The `role` half of the axis draws its values from here.
- The **DOES / WON'T / LIVES framing** — `dev-os/NODE-SCHEMA.md` (`does`/`wont`/`lives`) + the
  requirements-preview capability (`kickoff/README.md`).
- The **first consumer** — the wireframe-visual HTML (`WIREFRAME_VISUAL_REQUIREMENTS.md`, FR-WV).

## 0. Planning Insights (Self-Reflective Update)

> Grounded against the three real "audience" abstractions in the tree (not an assumed one):

| v0.1 Assumption | Grounding Discovery | Impact |
|---|---|---|
| One audience abstraction exists to extend | **Three** do: fluency (`concierge/audience.py`, built), role (`capability-index` `audiences:`, built-as-data), and the FR-DL-1 record `audience` field (adopted, unbuilt) | FR-AUD builds the **record field** and keys it on **role × fluency**; it reuses the concierge *pattern* but does not overload its enum (would be the overloaded-term anti-pattern). |
| Need a new resolver | `concierge/audience.py` already has the precedence ladder + the byte-identical-default invariant | FR-AUD-3 mirrors that ladder; unset ⇒ architect base ⇒ byte-identical (no regression to the terminal). |
| End-user text is a translation of architect text | The two serve different *questions* — architect: "is the contract right?"; end-user: "is this the app I pictured, and what must I supply?" | FR-AUD-C2 defines a distinct **DOES / WON'T / NEED** framing, not a reworded architect line. |
| Content can be LLM-generated per project | The wireframe is deterministic $0 no-LLM (Hitsuzen); an LLM preview would break byte-identity + trust | FR-AUD-C5: end-user narration is **authored per section**, filled with the user's real data — never model-written. |
| The layered axis is free | Two axes = real authoring + maintenance cost (the user accepted this trade) | FR-AUD-1/NR-1: the axis MUST degrade to base when a `(role,fluency)` cell is absent; you author only the cells you need, when you need them. |

**Resolved open questions:**
- **OQ-A → role × fluency, sparse.** The schema supports both axes but requires neither cell; resolution
  degrades (role,fluency) → (role,·) → base. You never author a full matrix.
- **OQ-B → HTML defaults to `(end_user, beginner)`; terminal to base (architect).** Unset everywhere ⇒
  today's architect text, byte-identical.

### 0.1 Lessons-Learned Hardening (v0.3)

- **[Overloaded-term co-location]** — did NOT extend `concierge.KickoffAudience` (kickoff-walk fluency) to
  carry reader-role; FR-AUD owns its own `(role, fluency)` key so two meanings don't stack in one enum.
- **[Single-source vocabulary ownership]** — the end-user *words* live in the descriptive manifest (one
  home), audience-keyed; the renderer holds none. The role list is owned by the capability-index/FR-J set
  and cited, not re-enumerated.
- **[Phantom-reference audit]** — `concierge/audience.py` symbols, FR-DL-1 `audience`, the `audiences:`
  keys, and NODE-SCHEMA `does`/`wont` were all grep-verified (see §Reference-Audit).
- **[CRP steering]** — least-reviewed = this doc. Settled: role × fluency axis; abstraction-first; authored
  (no-LLM) content; byte-identical default; reuse (not overload) the concierge pattern.

### 0.2 Design-Principle Hardening (v0.3.1)

> The layered axis the sponsor chose is where accidental complexity could enter — this section is load-bearing.

- **[Accidental-Complexity — the guard]** — a `(role × fluency)` matrix is justified **only** because it is
  *sparse + degrading*: an absent cell costs nothing and falls back to base, so the machinery never forces a
  full matrix and the default path is unchanged. If authoring a variant ever requires touching the resolver,
  the abstraction has failed — variants are pure data. **No new gate, no enum overload, no per-role code.**
- **[Hitsuzen]** — the end-user narration is authored + data-filled, never LLM-derived; determinism (FR-WV-6)
  and $0 are preserved.
- **[Mottainai]** — builds the *adopted* FR-DL-1 field and reuses the concierge ladder; regenerates neither.
- **[Genchi Genbutsu]** — end-user content names the user's **real** data (their record/field names), not
  generic placeholders; omission-surfacing (FR-AUD-C3) reflects the actual plan, never a fabricated gap.
- **[Context-Correctness-by-Construction]** — a requested `(role, fluency)` that isn't authored resolves to a
  defined fallback (never a blank/None narration); the resolver returns the base, always populated.

## 1. Problem Statement

The wireframe-visual can now *show* the structure — which makes the language problem obvious. Every word is
**architect voice**: "the DATA MODEL bookend," "31 entities · 155 CRUD routes," "AI passes," "schema.prisma."
The primary viewer is a **non-technical author** who should approve *what they're building* without learning
any of that. And no AI app-builder on the market walks an author **through the construction first** — so
authors discover missing fields, unwritten content, and "obvious once I saw it" gaps only *after* the build.
This layer makes the preview an **introduction to what's being built**, in the author's own language, early
enough to catch those gaps at requirements cost.

| Component | Current State | Gap |
|---|---|---|
| Section narration | architect voice only (`descriptive.yaml`) | no non-technical variant |
| Audience selection | none in the descriptive layer | can't ask for an end-user (or other-role) voice |
| Expectation-setting | "what it does" only | no "what we WON'T build" / "what you must PROVIDE" |
| Omission-surfacing | fields shown, gaps implicit | the author isn't *told* what's missing / needs input |

## 2. Requirements — the abstraction

- **FR-AUD-1 — Audience-keyed record variants (role × fluency).** A descriptive record MAY carry an
  `audience` map providing `what`/`why`/`do`/`next` variants keyed by `role` and, optionally, `fluency`.
  **Sparse + degrading:** resolution is `(role, fluency)` → `(role, ·)` → **base** (the current top-level
  fields = architect/intermediate). An absent cell is never an error. Keyed on the unit's stable key, not
  its label. (Builds FR-DL-1.)
- **FR-AUD-2 — Defaults preserve today.** Unset role/fluency ⇒ base ⇒ **byte-identical** terminal output.
  The wireframe-visual HTML requests `(end_user, beginner)`; the terminal `--describe` stays base (architect).
- **FR-AUD-3 — Resolver mirrors the concierge ladder, distinct axis.** `describe(section, plan, *, role,
  fluency)` resolves per FR-AUD-1; a project/global default MAY be set via the same flag→project→global→default
  precedence `concierge/audience.py` uses — but on `FR-AUD`'s own key, never by overloading `KickoffAudience`.
- **FR-AUD-4 — Audience is orthogonal to data.** Switching audience changes *only wording*; the shape, counts,
  statuses, mockups, and the plan JSON are identical across audiences (audience is presentation, not content).

## 2b. Requirements — the end-user content (what the words must do)

> These define the CONTENT to be authored (the prose lands next pass; here is the bar it must clear).

- **FR-AUD-C1 — Plain language, zero SDK jargon.** The `end_user` voice MUST avoid implementation vocabulary:
  no *entity, CRUD, schema, prisma, AI pass, manifest, cascade, FastAPI, endpoint, foreign key*. Speak the
  author's domain: *the things your app keeps track of, the pages people visit, the forms they fill in, the
  parts the computer fills in for you*.
- **FR-AUD-C2 — The DOES / WON'T / NEED framing.** Each section's end-user narration answers three questions,
  not one: **DOES** — what you're getting; **WON'T** — what this deliberately does *not* include (set
  expectations, prevent silent surprise); **NEED** — what *you* must provide (content to write, fields to
  confirm, decisions to make). (DOES/WON'T map to NODE-SCHEMA `does`/`wont`; NEED is the author's to-do.)
- **FR-AUD-C3 — Surface omissions, don't imply them.** The content MUST make "obvious once seen" gaps
  *explicit*: forms name what they do **not** collect; content sections name what is **unwritten**; empty
  states are called out. The goal: the author notices "where's the phone number?" *here*, not after the build.
- **FR-AUD-C4 — An introduction, not a report.** The top of the HTML frames the review task for a first-time
  viewer: *"Here's the app we're about to build for you — does it match what you pictured? What's missing?"*
  — before any counts or sections.
- **FR-AUD-C5 — Authored + data-filled, deterministic.** End-user narration is authored per section and
  filled with the author's **real** names (their record types, their field labels), never LLM-generated and
  never generic placeholders. $0, no-LLM, byte-stable (FR-WV-6 preserved).

## 3. Non-Requirements

- **NR-1 — Not a full matrix.** We author only the cells we need (start: `end_user` base fluency + the existing
  architect base). Other roles/fluencies are added on demand; absent ones degrade.
- **NR-2 — Not auto-translation.** No LLM rewrites architect→end-user; the end-user voice is authored.
- **NR-3 — Not a terminal change.** `--describe`'s default stays architect/base (byte-identical).
- **NR-4 — Not a re-spec.** Does not redefine the descriptive layer, NODE-SCHEMA, or the concierge audience
  module — it builds FR-DL-1 and reuses the rest.
- **NR-5 — Not hi-fi / not content generation.** Surfaces what's planned + what's missing; never writes the
  app's real content for the author.

## 4. Open Questions

- **OQ-AUD-1 — Fluency values for reading.** Reuse `beginner/intermediate/advanced` labels, or a reading-specific
  set (`plain/standard/detailed`)? (Lean: reuse the concierge labels to avoid a second vocabulary.)
- **OQ-AUD-2 — Where do project/global audience defaults live** if the HTML default isn't enough — `build-preferences.yaml`
  (concierge's home) or a wireframe-visual flag (`--audience end_user`)? (Lean: a `--audience` flag now; project pref later.)
- **OQ-AUD-3 — NEED as data vs prose.** Is "what you must provide" derivable from the plan (unwritten content %,
  unconfirmed fields) so it's partly *computed*, not only authored? (Investigate next pass; FR-AUD-C3 candidates.)

## 5. Build status (2026-07-18)

**Abstraction + content both shipped** (full suite 148 pass; terminal `--describe` byte-identical):

- **FR-AUD-1..4 ✅** — `_variant()` (role,fluency)→(role,·)→base resolver; `describe`/`describe_summary`/
  `compose`/`render_html` thread `role`/`fluency`; default = base (byte-identical); HTML = `(end_user, beginner)`.
- **FR-AUD-C1..C5 ✅ (content authored)** — end_user variants for **all 10 sections + the summary**, each
  carrying the **DOES / WON'T / NEED** framing (`what` / `wont` / `need`) + a friendly `title` + plain
  `do`/`next`. `why` is skipped in the end_user render (its base value is architect voice). No jargon.
- **Gap-3 decision (FR-AUD-4 boundary):** *presentation* strings get an audience form — section **titles**
  (audience `title` override) + the summary **band** (plain labels Health/Size/Content/Ready + deterministic
  `plain_shape`/`plain_status`/`plain_content`). *Data* strings stay data, but the end_user HTML **hides the
  raw item `detail`** (`fields: … | omitted …`) when a mockup already shows it — the visual is the plain form.
- **Verified live on strtd8** (chrome-devtools, 0 console errors): band + titles + section framing all render
  in plain language; un-authored *roles* still degrade to base (sparse invariant holds).
- **Fluency axis ✅ (OQ-AUD-1 resolved: reuse beginner/intermediate/advanced).** Authored for the
  **`end_user` role ONLY** (single-role, per sponsor) on the highest-depth-value spots — `forms` +
  `entities` (full framing) + the `summary` intro. Default `intermediate` = the standard content
  (unchanged); `beginner` = fuller/with-analogy, `advanced` = terse. Other roles ignore fluency;
  un-authored sections degrade to the end_user standard. Zero new machinery — the `_variant` resolver
  already handled `(role,fluency)`.
- **CLI flags ✅ (OQ-AUD-2 resolved).** `wireframe --html <path> [--audience end_user|architect]
  [--fluency intermediate|beginner|advanced]` — scoped to `--html`; unknown values degrade to base.
  Verified live on strtd8: all three depths + the architect voice render (0 console errors).
- **Residual (next):** the `Ready to build?` value + item labels (`X create/edit form`) are lightly
  technical; fluency is authored on 3 spots (extend to more sections on demand — sparse invariant).

---

*v0.4 — Abstraction + end-user content both built (§5). Grounded on the three real audience abstractions.*
*v0.3.1 — Post planning + lessons + principle hardening. Grounded on the three real audience abstractions.
Builds the adopted FR-DL-1 field as a sparse, degrading (role × fluency) axis; reuses the concierge ladder +
byte-identical-default; defines the end-user DOES/WON'T/NEED content bar. Abstraction-first (this pass);
end-user prose authored next pass. Ready for CRP.*

## Appendix: Iterative Review Log (Applied / Rejected Suggestions)

This appendix is intentionally **append-only**. New reviewers (human or model) add suggestions to Appendix C; once validated, the orchestrator records the final disposition in Appendix A (applied) or Appendix B (rejected with rationale). **Do not delete A/B** — they are the cross-model memory that stops later reviewers from re-proposing settled or rejected ideas.

### Reviewer Instructions (for humans + models)

- **Before suggesting changes**: Scan Appendix A and Appendix B first. Do **not** re-suggest items already applied or explicitly rejected.
- **When proposing changes**: Append a `#### Review Round R{n}` block under Appendix C (n = highest existing round + 1, or 1), with unique suggestion IDs `R{n}-S{k}` (plan) / `R{n}-F{k}` (requirements).
- **When endorsing prior suggestions**: If you agree with an untriaged item from a prior round, list it in an **Endorsements** section instead of restating it. Multi-reviewer endorsements raise triage priority.
- **When validating (orchestrator)**: For each suggestion, append a row to Appendix A (applied) or Appendix B (rejected) referencing the suggestion ID.
- **If rejecting**: Record **why** (specific rationale) so future reviewers don't re-propose the same idea.

### Appendix A: Applied Suggestions

| ID | Suggestion | Source | Implementation / Validation Notes | Date |
|----|------------|--------|-----------------------------------|------|
| (none yet) |  |  |  |  |

### Appendix B: Rejected Suggestions (with Rationale)

| ID | Suggestion | Source | Rejection Rationale | Date |
|----|------------|--------|---------------------|------|
| (none yet) |  |  |  |  |

### Appendix C: Incoming Suggestions (Untriaged, append-only)

#### Review Round R1 — claude-opus-4-8-1m — 2026-07-18

- **Reviewer**: claude-opus-4-8-1m
- **Date**: 2026-07-18 (UTC)
- **Scope**: Single-document requirements review (FR-AUD). Weighted to the 6 sponsor focus asks; honors the SETTLED list (role×fluency axis, single-role fluency, authored no-LLM, byte-identical default, reuse-not-overload concierge, sparse-degrading). No prose rewrites; no triage.

##### Focus-ask answers (address before F-suggestions)

**Ask 1 — Is DOES / WON'T / NEED the right content model, and should NEED be partly computed (OQ-AUD-3)?**
- **Summary answer:** Yes on the model; **partial** — NEED should be a *computed floor* the author annotates, not either/or.
- **Rationale:** The product thesis in §1 ("catch missing form fields / unwritten content / obvious-once-seen gaps at requirements cost") is an *omission-detection* claim, but FR-AUD-C2's NEED is authored ("the author's to-do") while FR-AUD-C3 already demands omissions be *explicit* ("forms name what they do **not** collect; content sections name what is **unwritten**"). §5 shows the plan-derived signals already exist and flow: `_plain_status` reads `not_defined`/`placeholder`/`invalid` counts and `_plain_content` reads `content_coverage` ("About {pct}% of the words are written"). An author-only NEED can silently *miss* a gap the plan already knows about — the exact failure the thesis exists to prevent (Mottainai: the data is in hand and being discarded for the NEED field).
- **Assumptions / conditions:** `content_coverage`, `status_counts`, and per-field confirmation state are available per-section at compose time (grounded for the summary band; per-section availability is an assumption).
- **Suggested improvements:** See R1-F1 (computed NEED floor + author-augment), R1-F5 (acceptance test).

**Ask 2 — Is the FR-AUD-4 data-vs-presentation boundary drawn right (titles/band = presentation; labels/detail = data)?**
- **Summary answer:** **Partial** — the boundary is coherent but under-specified where it matters most (item *labels*), and §5's own "Residual" admits labels stay "lightly technical."
- **Rationale:** FR-AUD-4 says audience changes "*only wording*" and §5's Gap-3 decision classes item `detail` as data (hidden when a mockup shows it) but item *labels* (`X create/edit form`) as data too — yet FR-AUD-C1 bans exactly this register ("no *entity, CRUD, ... endpoint*"; "the forms they fill in"). A non-technical reader still meets "create/edit form" jargon on every item. The line is drawn by *field* (title/band vs label/detail) when it should be drawn by *reader-facing surface*.
- **Assumptions / conditions:** Item labels are rendered in the end_user HTML (not only in a hidden/expandable region).
- **Suggested improvements:** See R1-F2 (make the boundary a testable rule keyed on reader-visibility, and give item labels an audience `title`-style override).

**Ask 3 — Per-field degrade leak: is skipping `why` the right fix, or should an authored variant resolve at record level?**
- **Summary answer:** Skipping `why` is a **point patch, not the fix**; specify record-level (or explicit-null) resolution for authored variants.
- **Rationale:** Grounded in `describe.py::_variant` — `pick()` iterates `(fluency_v, role_v, rec)` per field, so *any* field an `end_user` variant omits inherits the architect base verbatim. `why` was the known leak, but `do`/`next`/`what` have the identical exposure; the doc only closes one hole. This is a Context-Correctness-by-Construction gap: a "sparse cell" silently borrows architect voice rather than signaling absence.
- **Assumptions / conditions:** `_variant`'s per-field fallback (lines 78–83) is the shipped resolver; the render-side `why` skip lives in the template/compose, not the resolver.
- **Suggested improvements:** See R1-F3 (spec the authored-variant resolution rule + a jargon-leak assertion over the rendered end_user fields).

**Ask 4 — Sparse-coverage UX risk: what is the completeness bar before a real user, and does unevenness confuse?**
- **Summary answer:** **Depends** — uneven *fluency* depth is low-risk, but uneven *role* completeness needs a stated bar; today there is none.
- **Rationale:** §5 "Residual" says fluency is authored on only 3 spots and future roles are empty. The sparse invariant makes this *safe* (no errors) but not *non-confusing*: a page where 3 spots deepen at `beginner` and the rest stay `intermediate` can read as inconsistent authorial attention. NR-1 permits partial authoring but no requirement defines "ready for a real end_user."
- **Assumptions / conditions:** The v0.4 release target is the `end_user` role specifically (per §5), not multi-role.
- **Suggested improvements:** See R1-F4 (define an `end_user`-role completeness bar as an acceptance gate; scope fluency-unevenness explicitly as accepted).

**Ask 5 — Acceptance test for the omission-catching thesis (falsifiable, short of a user study)?**
- **Summary answer:** **Yes, and it is currently missing** — "renders" is tested (§5: 148 pass) but "*catches* omissions" has no criterion.
- **Rationale:** The entire product differentiator (§1, FR-AUD-C3) is untested; §5 only asserts rendering + byte-identity. A falsifiable proxy exists without a user study: seed-a-gap → assert-the-preview-names-it.
- **Assumptions / conditions:** A fixture plan can be constructed with a deliberately absent field/unwritten section.
- **Suggested improvements:** See R1-F5 (mutation-style acceptance criterion under FR-AUD-C3).

**Ask 6 — `plain_*` derivation robustness across edge-case plans?**
- **Summary answer:** **Mostly robust but under-specified** — `_plain_content` guards `total == 0`, but `_plain_shape`/`_plain_status` have no authored empty-project criterion and pluralization is only informally covered.
- **Rationale:** Grounded in `compose.py`: `_plain_content` handles divide-by-zero (`if overall.total == 0: return "No text to write yet."`) and `_plain` handles singular/plural; but `_plain_shape` on a 0-entity/0-page plan emits "0 things tracked · 0 screens · …" (technically correct, arguably confusing as a *first-time* introduction, FR-AUD-C4), and `_plain_status` returns the reassuring "Everything's planned — nothing missing" even for an *empty* project (all counts zero ⇒ no issues ⇒ false "all good"). No requirement pins these edge outputs.
- **Assumptions / conditions:** Shipped `compose.py` lines 93–125 are the derivation surface; `content_coverage.overall.total` is the only guarded zero.
- **Suggested improvements:** See R1-F6 (edge-case acceptance table for `plain_*`, incl. the empty-project false-positive).

##### Executive summary (≤10 bullets)

- Biggest lever (thesis-critical): NEED is authored-only while the plan already computes the gap signals — omissions can be silently under-reported (R1-F1).
- The omission-catching thesis has **no falsifiable acceptance criterion**; only "renders" and "byte-identical" are tested (R1-F5).
- The per-field degrade leak is closed only for `why`; `what`/`do`/`next` share the identical architect-inheritance path (R1-F3).
- FR-AUD-4's data/presentation line leaves item *labels* ("create/edit form") in jargon that FR-AUD-C1 explicitly bans (R1-F2).
- No stated **completeness bar** for the `end_user` role before it reaches a real user (R1-F4).
- `plain_status` reports "nothing missing" for an *empty* project — a false reassurance for a first-time author (R1-F6).
- FR-AUD-C1's jargon ban is a prose bar with no automated check despite being deterministic and testable (R1-F7).
- OQ-AUD-3's resolution is deferred but §5 already ships the data that would resolve it — the OQ and the build state have drifted (R1-F1 / R1-F8).
- "Byte-identical" (FR-AUD-2) is asserted but the *anchor* it must stay identical to is not pinned (R1-F9).

##### Numbered suggestions

- **R1-F1** *(Validation / Data)* — **Specify NEED as a computed floor the author augments, not authored-only.** FR-AUD-C2 defines NEED as "the author's to-do" (authored), yet §5 ships `_plain_status`/`_plain_content` which already derive unconfirmed/unwritten counts from the plan. Add a clause to FR-AUD-C2 (or resolve OQ-AUD-3 in-doc): NEED MUST include, at minimum, the plan-derived gaps (fields in `not_defined`/`placeholder`, sections below 100% content coverage), with authored prose layered on top. *Anchor:* FR-AUD-C2 "NEED — what *you* must provide … (NEED is the author's to-do)". *Testable:* fixture plan with N `not_defined` fields ⇒ assert NEED enumerates ≥ N items.
- **R1-F2** *(Interfaces / Data)* — **Redraw the FR-AUD-4 boundary on reader-visibility and give item labels an audience override.** §5 classes item labels ("`X create/edit form`") as "data" that stays, but §5 Residual concedes they are "lightly technical" and FR-AUD-C1 bans "form/endpoint" register. Make FR-AUD-4 testable: *any string rendered in the end_user HTML* is subject to FR-AUD-C1; give item labels a `title`-style audience override (as titles already have). *Anchor:* FR-AUD-4 "audience is presentation, not content" + §5 "item labels … are lightly technical". *Testable:* grep the rendered end_user DOM for the FR-AUD-C1 banned-word list ⇒ zero hits (see R1-F7).
- **R1-F3** *(Risks / Data)* — **Spec authored-variant resolution to eliminate the per-field architect leak generally.** `describe.py::_variant.pick()` falls back per field to the architect base for `what`/`why`/`do`/`next`; the doc only patches `why` (skipped in render). Add a requirement: when a `(role,·)` variant is authored, an omitted narration field MUST resolve to empty/absent (record-level or explicit-null), NOT silently to the architect base — OR the doc must state that inheriting base is intended and enumerate which fields are safe. *Anchor:* §5 "`why` is skipped in the end_user render (its base value is architect voice)". *Testable:* author an `end_user` variant omitting `do`; assert rendered `do` is not the architect string.
- **R1-F4** *(Validation)* — **Define an `end_user`-role completeness bar as an acceptance gate.** §5 Residual: fluency on 3 spots, future roles empty — but no requirement states what "done enough for a real user" means. Add a criterion to §5 or a new FR-AUD-C6: the `end_user` role is user-ready when all 10 sections + summary carry authored DOES/WON'T/NEED (fluency remains explicitly optional/sparse). *Anchor:* §5 "Residual (next)". *Testable:* assert every section key has an `end_user` `what`/`wont`/`need` authored.
- **R1-F5** *(Validation)* — **Add a falsifiable omission-catching acceptance criterion under FR-AUD-C3.** The thesis (§1) is untested. Add: given a fixture plan mutated to drop a known field (e.g. remove `phone` from a contact entity) or leave a content section unwritten, the composed end_user view MUST contain a NEED/omission string naming that gap; removing the gap removes the string. *Anchor:* FR-AUD-C3 "the author notices 'where's the phone number?' *here*, not after the build." *Testable:* mutation test (seed-gap ⇒ assert-named; no-gap ⇒ assert-absent).
- **R1-F6** *(Risks / Validation)* — **Pin `plain_*` edge-case outputs, especially the empty-project false reassurance.** `_plain_status` returns "Everything's planned — nothing missing or broken." when all counts are zero — including an *empty* project, contradicting FR-AUD-C4's first-time-viewer framing. Add an acceptance table under §5 or FR-AUD-C5 covering: 0 entities, all `not_defined`, empty project, singular vs plural, `content total == 0`. *Anchor:* `compose.py` `_plain_status` / FR-AUD-C4. *Testable:* parametrized test over the edge table with asserted strings.

##### Stress-test / adversarial pass

- **R1-F7** *(Validation / Security-of-voice)* — **Make FR-AUD-C1's jargon ban an automated deterministic check, not a prose aspiration.** FR-AUD-C1 enumerates a concrete banned-word list ("entity, CRUD, schema, prisma, AI pass, manifest, cascade, FastAPI, endpoint, foreign key") — this is machine-checkable. Add: a test asserts the rendered `end_user` HTML/view-model contains none of the FR-AUD-C1 banned tokens (case-insensitive, word-boundary). *Anchor:* FR-AUD-C1 banned list. *Testable:* the check itself is the acceptance criterion; it also enforces R1-F2.
- **R1-F8** *(Consistency)* — **Reconcile OQ-AUD-3 (open) with §5 (shipped signals).** OQ-AUD-3 asks whether NEED is "derivable from the plan … Investigate next pass," but §5 already ships `_plain_content`/`_plain_status` deriving exactly those figures — the open question and the build status have drifted. Either close OQ-AUD-3 citing §5, or state precisely what remains open (per-*section* vs summary-band derivation). *Anchor:* OQ-AUD-3 "Investigate next pass" vs §5 "OQ-AUD-2 resolved" (OQ-AUD-3 conspicuously left open). *Testable:* doc-consistency check (no OQ contradicts a §5 shipped claim).
- **R1-F9** *(Validation)* — **Pin the byte-identity anchor FR-AUD-2 must hold against.** FR-AUD-2/NR-3 promise "byte-identical" terminal output but name no stored baseline. Add: the acceptance check is a golden-file / snapshot of `--describe` default output that CI diffs on every FR-AUD change. *Anchor:* FR-AUD-2 "byte-identical terminal output"; §5 "terminal `--describe` byte-identical". *Testable:* committed golden file + diff assertion (states *how* "byte-identical" is verified, currently only asserted).
