"""Descriptive-layer composer for `startd8 wireframe` (FR-DL-1/5/8/9).

Reads the authored ``descriptive.yaml`` manifest and composes the what/why/do narration for one
:class:`WireframeSection`, filling ``{{count}}`` / ``{{status}}`` placeholders from the *live*
section. Deterministic, no-LLM (Hitsuzen, FR-DL-8): the output is a pure function of
(authored record × live plan). One source — this manifest — behind the section narration; the
renderer holds no narration strings (FR-DL-5).

Mirrors the proven attorney-portal composer (``work/legal/attorney-portal/app/descriptive.py``):
a cached YAML load, a per-key record lookup, and a template-fill returning a plain dict.

Scope (M-DL0/M-DL1/M-DL2/M-DL4/M-DL5): what/why/do/next per section + the aggregate `summary`
record (FR-DL-12, the header's meaning). Not yet built — audience variants (FR-DL-1 optional),
workflow-position inference (M-DL3/FR-DL-4), or the 3-axis facets (FR-DL-11).
